# Card Segmentation

## Develop Guide

1. Coding style
   - PEP-8
   - [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
   - [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8)
2. Pre-commit
   - We integrate [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) into our
     framework to make sure the consistency of coding style. If you use `git commit`
     inside docker container, it will check whether coding style is compliant to our
     requirement or not. Instead of docker env, if you use `git commit` in another env,
     you may need to run the following command first:
     ```sh
     cd card-segmentation/
     pip3 install pre-commit==2.6.0
     pre-commit install --install-hooks
     ```

## Setup

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/),
   [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and
   [nvidia-docker2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
2. Clone repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NickLi0605/card_segmentation.git
   ```
3. Run docker-compose
   ```sh
   cd card_segmentation
   docker-compose up
   ```
   Note: this docker image will start jupyter notebook automatically.
4. Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer)
5. Create virtual env for python with **pyenv**
   ```sh
   pyenv install 3.8.3
   pyenv virtualenv 3.8.3 <venv_name> # create virtual env
   pyenv local <venv_name>  # apply virtualenv for the project
   ```
6. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```
7. Enable pre-commit hooks
   ```sh
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```
